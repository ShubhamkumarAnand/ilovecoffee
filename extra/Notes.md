# Nest Notes

- Controllers essentially deal with the routes of your application.

 1. Controllers: A controller’s sole purpose is to receive requests for the application and deal with routes.

 2. Service Layer: This part of the block should only include business logic. For example, all the CRUD operations and methods to determine how data can be created, stored and updated.

 3. Data Access Layer: This layer takes care and provides logic to access data stored in persistent storage of some kind.
